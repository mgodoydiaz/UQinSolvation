# Uncertainty Quantification in solvation energy of molecules due to atom position

## Abstract

The Poisson and Poisson-Boltzmann equation allow us to describe electrostatic interactions of a molecule inserted in an ionic solution. Through the implicit solvent model and boundary element method it is possible to estimate parameters of interest such as the solvation energy or electrostatic free energy of a molecule by having information of the position and charge of the solute atoms. The position of these atoms is empirically represented and has a degree of uncertainty due to measurement and molecular vibrations that cause thermal properties.

The purpose of this work is to quantify uncertainty generated by the position of the solute atoms in the solvation energy of molecules. For this, several models of random generation of atom positions (shake) were implemented and statistical parameters were calculated using the Monte Carlo method. The results obtained by three shake models are reported: atoms move randomly within spheres of constant radius, according their connectivity, and within spheres of radius according to their mass. The data show that this methodology works to quantify uncertainty and find relationships between variables that may be related to the objectives of this work.
